# Vector and Stack classes

This library provides two basic data structures: Vector and Stack, both implemented in C++. The Vector class is a dynamic array, and the Stack class is a simple stack data structure using the Vector class as the underlying container. The library contains several basic functionalities and operators to perform standard operations on these data structures.

## Features

### Vector
Dynamic resizing
Insertion and deletion of elements
Access to elements using array-like indexing
Capacity and size management
Clearing the vector
Comparison operators: ==, !=, <, <=, >, and >=
### Stack
Push and pop operations
Access to the top element without removal
Size and empty status checking
Arithmetic operations on all elements: +=, -=, *=, and /=
Appending another stack using the += operator
Comparison operators: < and >
## How to Build

Clone the repository or download the source code.
Compile the source code using a C++ compiler with C++11 support.
Run the compiled executable file.
## Usage

Include the Vector.h and Stack.h header files in your project, and create instances of the Vector and Stack classes as needed.

Refer to the main.cpp file for example usage of the classes and their functionalities.
